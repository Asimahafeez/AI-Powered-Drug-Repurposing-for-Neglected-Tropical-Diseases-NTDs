This project provides a simple AI-based tool to support drug repurposing research for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
It uses a machine learning model trained on example data to predict potential drug–pathogen relationships.

## Features

* Input data manually or upload a CSV file
* Predict outcomes using a trained machine learning model
* Interactive table view of results
* Download predictions as CSV
* Deployable with Streamlit

## Files

* **app.py** – Main Streamlit application
* **requirements.txt** – Required Python packages
* **model\_ntd.joblib** – Pre-trained machine learning model
* **sample\_data.csv** – Example dataset for quick testing

## Installation

Clone this repository and install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Live Demo: https://ai-powered-drug-repurposing-for-neglected-tropical-diseases-nt.streamlit.app/
## Usage

1. Run the app locally or deploy on Streamlit Cloud
2. Provide drug/pathogen-related input manually or upload a dataset
3. View predicted results and download them for further analysis
